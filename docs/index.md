# Soundstorm

[Soundstorm][] is a federated audio platform that lets you and your friends
upload their own tracks and share them on the [fediverse][]. A fully
democratized music service, it allows content creators and consumers
alike to increase their reach throughout the world without succumbing to
the wills of any large corporation. Anyone can run a Soundstorm
instance, and by putting your content on a Soundstorm instance, anyone
can reach a massive audience beyond the realms of [FAANG][].

## Why Soundstorm?

Unlike most other streaming services and platforms, Soundstorm is fully
[open-source](/open-source.html) and can be deployed onto your own
infrastructure with relative ease, using [Kubernetes][] or [Heroku][].
Although there are some costs involved with running your own server,
you don't need to run a server to join the network. Many Soundstorm
instances are open and can be joined. Read below to see what that's all
about.

## What is Federation?

By taking advantage of the [ActivityPub][] protocol, Soundstorm is
interoperable with any other social network that speaks it. This means
that people on a [Mastodon][] instance can follow users on a Soundstorm
instance, and receive new updates directly in their feed without any
need for account synchronization. An additional advantage to federated
content is that you can run your own Soundstorm instance, and we make it
[pretty easy to do so](/getting-started.html), so owning the content you
upload is not only possible, but also less dependent on a large-scale
streaming service and their inefficiencies.
